      "- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework to help large language models be more accurate and more up-to-date. This refers to large language modeling, or LLMs, that generate text in response to a user query, referred to as a prompt. These models can have some undesirable behavior. I want to tell you an anecdote to illustrate what I'm saying. So my kids, they recently asked me this question: \"In our solar system, what planet has the most moons?\" And I read an article and the article said that Jupiter and 88 moons. So that's really great that you're asking this question.\n",
      "- I don't know. I don’t have a source. I'm out of date. So we have two problems. One is no source. And the second problem is that I am out ofdate. And these, in fact, are often observed as problematic when interacting with Large Language Models (LARMs). They're LLM challenges. Now, what would have happened if I'd taken a beat and first gone and looked up the answer on a reputable source likeNASA. Well, then I would have been able to say, \"Ah, okay! So the answer is Saturn with 146 moons.\" And in reality, this keeps changing because scientists keep on discovering more and more moons.\n",
      "- A large language model would confidently say, OK, I have been trained and from what I know in my parameters during my training, the answer is Jupiter. But, you know, we don't know. The largest language model is very confident in what it answered. Now, what happens when you add this retrieval-augmented part here? What does that mean? Now, instead of just relying on what the LLM knows, we are adding a content store. This could be open like the internet. This can be closed like some collection of documents, collection of policies, whatever. The point, though, now, is that the LGM first goes and talks to the content store and says, “Hey, can you retrieve for me information that is relevant to what the user's query was?” And now, with this retrievation-augmented answer, it's not Jupiter anymore, we know that it is Saturn.\n",
      "- Now in RAG, the generative model actually has an instruction that says, \"No, no, no.\" \"First, go and retrieve relevant content.\" \"Combine that with the user's question and only then generate the answer.\" \"Now you can give evidence for why your response was what it was. And in fact, now you can prove why your answer was what you was. So now hopefully you can see, how does RAG help the two LLM challenges that I had mentioned before? So first of all,\n",
      "- Let's take a closer look at what's going to happen to the large language model if it doesn't have evidence to back it up. Let' s talk about what'll happen if we don' t have enough evidence. Let 'em know if there's anything we can do about it. Let me know what you're thinking, and I'll do my utmost to get it right. Thanks for your help. I'd love to hear from you.\n",
      "- Thank you for learning more about RAG and like and subscribe to the channel. We are both working to improve the retriever to give the large language model the best quality data on which to ground its response, and also the generative part so that the LLM can give the richest, best response, finally to the user when it generates the answer.
